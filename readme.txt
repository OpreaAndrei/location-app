 -- Information about application --
 
 ## Frontend was made with Android Studio ##
 ## Backend was made with Java Spring Boot ##
 
 The main goal of this application is to send your current device location to a database when you press a button.
 
 To use this application you should register / login if you already have an account.
 Based on the user type you could perform certain actions.
 
 Currently android application have suport just for basic user who can send his current location but backend application have full
 functionality both for admin user and basic user ( tested with postman ).
 
 Basic type user can see his current locations, create a new  location, detele a specific location based on id( only for his id), 
 update specific location based on id( only for  his id)
 
 Admin type user can see all locations in database, create a new location, delete specific location based on id, update specific location based on id
 and filter all locations between given dates.
 
 Admin type interface was meant to be an Angular application and I hope I can finish it soon.
